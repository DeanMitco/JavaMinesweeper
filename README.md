# JavaMinesweeper
This is a Java Minesweeper Game made by me. This contains JavaFX. 

It has 3 modes (easy, medium, hard) where you can switch between them. After a game has been started, this can be restarted with a click on the bottom button. Bombcount will show how many bombs there are on the field. The count with the flags dont work yet, but will in the future.
